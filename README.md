## ðŸ“Œ Overview

Alexa is a virtual assistant backed by Amazon. All of its business rules revolves around the concept of Skills, that are used by Alexa to make some actions.

Per example, in case you have some IoT products at your house, you are able to turn them on by asking it for Alexa.

Being minded about it, we are able to create skills in order to make custom experiences for ourselves.
